          <p>Hi, I'm Schuyler. Welcome to my simple Week 1 Code Review landing page! I'm a new student in the Intro to Programming course at Epicodus. Coming into this, I've had only a few weeks of online programming training.</p>
          <p>I'm really happy a place like Epicodus exists because I've never been a big proponent of the traditional education system. I've begun a few different four-year programs in the past and always became frustrated/burnt-out with how much time it would require.</p>
          <p>My working experience consists almost completely of restaurant work in New York City. I currently part-own a small restaurant/bar group, but it's time to progress. I can't wait to learn all that I can with Epicodus, and look forward to seeing where programming will take me!</p>

          <h3>Projects</h3>
          <p>Since I've been at Epicodus, various partners and I have created the following, with the most recent work at listed first:</p>
          <ul><a href="http://schuylermk.github.io/Vacation/">Vacation Project</a></ul>
          <ul><a href="http://schuylermk.github.io/shelter/">Animal Shelter</a></ul>
          <ul><a href="http://schuylermk.github.io/Interior/">Interiors</a></ul>
          <p>Progress has been made, to say the least!</p>
